### Personal

In my leisure time, I am a fan of [swimming](https://case.edu/wellness/facultystaff/resources/fitness/veale-recreation-center) (summer), 
[hiking](https://fitt.co/cleveland/articles/hiking-spots-around-cleveland) (spring and fall), 
[skiing](https://www.bmbw.com/) (winter) and e-sports (all seasons!).
