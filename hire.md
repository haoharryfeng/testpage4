#### Description

One to two postdoctoral scholar position(s) in statistical bioinformatics are available immediately at [the Hao Feng Lab](https://hfenglab.org/) at Case Western Reserve University. The research goal of the Feng Lab is to utilize statistical approaches to understand high-throughput computational biology data. Using data-driven approach and computational methods, we translate the -omics signal from benchwork data to knowledge in precision medicine. We aim to combine cutting-edge biotechnologies with various types of data to make biomedical discoveries. The successful candidate will be actively engaged in statistical methodology development and/or applied collaboration research in bioinformatics. The specific research focus can be tailored to the applicant. 
The successful candidate will benefit particularly from our partnerships with Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine’s affiliated medical institutions, such as Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), the University Hospitals Health System, the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (UHCMC), The MetroHealth System, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Through these partnerships, cutting-edge technologies, research facilities and collaboration opportunities are available to postdoctoral scholar(s). 
The anticipated duration of the position is 2 years (extendable) with a negotiable start date. 

#### Qualifications:
1.	Candidates should have a recent doctoral degree in biostatistics, statistics, bioinformatics, biomedical informatics or related field. ABD (All-But-Degree) doctoral students are encouraged to apply. 
2.	Proficiency in statistical computing in R.
3.	Experience in using High-Performance Computing. 
4.	Experience in biology is preferred, but not required. 


#### Salary Range
Stipend commensurate with experience based on NIH standard guideline.  

#### Visa
