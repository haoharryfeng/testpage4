I am is a tenure-track assistant professor in biostatistics at the 
[Department of Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences](http://epbiwww.case.edu/)
at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and an associate member at [Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCCC)](https://case.edu/cancer/).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biostatistics from [Emory University](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) under the guidance of
professor [Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/). Before that, I received my MSPH degree in biostatistics from Emory University (2013) and my BS degree 
from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (2011). 


I am a statistician focusing on problems in bioinformatics. Developing statistical methods for high-throughput _omics_ data is a 
major component of my research. In the past, I utilized epigenomics data to define biomarkers, classify cancer 
subtypes and predict disease in cell-free DNA. I also collaborate closely with physicians 
and wet-lab researchers on various projects including cancer, virus, trauma, and neurodegenerative disease studies.
