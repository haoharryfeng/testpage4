I am is a tenure-track assistant professor in the 
[Department of Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences](pqhs.case.edu)
at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and an associate member at [Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCCC)](https://case.edu/cancer/).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Biostatistics from [Emory University](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) under the guidance of
professor [Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/). Before that, I 


Karl is an applied statistician focusing on problems in genetics and
genomics &ndash; particularly the analysis of meiotic recombination and the
genetic dissection of complex traits in experimental organisms. The
latter is often called &ldquo;QTL mapping.&rdquo; A QTL is a
_quantitative trait locus_ &ndash; a genetic locus that influences a
quantitative trait. Recently he has been focusing on the development
of interactive data visualizations for high-dimensional genetic data;
see his [R/qtlcharts package](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) and
his [D3 examples](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3).
